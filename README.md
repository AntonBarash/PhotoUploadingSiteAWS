# PhotoUploadingSiteAWS
AWS files for uploading for my photo uploading site.
To get the correct zip representation of all files either just download the zip folder, or download all files and then:
-put templates into templates folder
-put python.config into .ebextensions folder
-put other files into directory with templates and .ebextensions folders
-and zip up all those files from that directory
